CyberPatriot is a competition for youth teams to find and fix cybersecurity vulnerabilities in virtual operating systems. Members are forced to use a proprietary competition system, teams are scored on how secure they make the system. I was a member of the CyberPatriot team and competed in the CyberPatriot Competition. I had to collaborate with a team to resolve issues in various operating systems like Windows 10, Windows 10 Server, Linux, and Cisco networking. I was specifically responsible for the Windows 10 Server and with our team's efforts actually made it to National Finals but lost the final round.
