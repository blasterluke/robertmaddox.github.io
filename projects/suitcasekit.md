One of the many issues that pose problems to up and coming drummers is convienence. Let's face it, drumkits are unwieldly, large, and heavy. They're a pain in the butt to move around, pack, and setup. Well I saw this and posed an idea to create a drumkit to fix this. 

I've been in quite a few startup garage bands and only once did I have the benefit of practicing in a space with a drumkit already setup. Besides that, I had to take a kit with me or store one away. It could take 15-20 to setup which is a large portion of time that could go to practicing.
