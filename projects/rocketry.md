At Mililani High School, our rocketry team took on the TARC Rocket Challenge. There were several struggles that arose with this endeavor. Financing was a huge problem for the Rocketry Club, and resulted in the host teacher paying for most of the expenses out of pocket. As the Treasurer, the Vice President of the club and made a presentation for the principal to propose funding for the club. Thankfully we did get it.

That money went lots of new equpiment and rocket kits. Since any rockets we lost would be detrimental to the clubs fleet. For the longest time we had no way to replace any of the rockets and equipment.
