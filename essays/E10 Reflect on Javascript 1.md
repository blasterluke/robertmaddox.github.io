From a standpoint, Javascript hasn't been too bad so far. Specifically when taking a crack at the practice WODs and the FreeCodeCamp. 
For myself it's a fair bit easier than C and Java which are the most recent languages I've been using. Javascript actually seems like it would be a great place to start for beginners, especially with the simplicity of its "first-class citizen" functions. When first learning Java it was a bit hard to piece together some of the logic behind functions and object attributes, and it felt like in Javascript it was incredibly intuitive. Regarding its usefulness in software engineering is subjective. I believe it holds a key role in web development due to its ease of access and intuitive features.
I don't think it replaces other languages, for example it would be a poor choice to use Javascript for more intensive programs when alternatives like Java and C++ exist. So while it has a space in web development, it's not necessarily the prime language for all use cases. 

Going into the class, I was (and still am) a bit worried about the "all-or-nothing" WODs. The practice WODs that we've done so far really haven't been too bad, and the logic that I've used in previous courses seems to be translating over pretty well. I'm looking forward to allowing this class to help me dive into projects that I can utilize to build my professional portfolio as well as tackle personal projects that I haven't had the drive to complete. Specifically, a friend and I wanted to start working on a game, he would be in charge of the assets and concepts while I would be tackling majority of the gameplay and programming.
Some progress was made but nothing close to being done. With this class I'm hoping to take some of the skills and strategies into my personal projects to help see them through. Another project that I wanted to complete was a special kind of portable audio mixer/interface that had some key features making it ideal for live band practices.

Looking to the future, I'm hoping that this class can help spark a moment in my CS career that will pivot my abilities. After all, these projects can make or break future job prospects. In the beginning of the class the professor showed off a bunch of different completed projects submitted by students that all seemed a bit daunting. I was immediately thinking about what my project would be. 
An idea that I had was to create an app to help bands and performers to rate different venues. Similar to Google Maps or other map apps with reviews. Hopefully as we get further into the semester I can figure out how to accomplish this by using Javascript, and this project will see the light of day.
