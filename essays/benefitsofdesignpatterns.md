## Design Patterns in 314

In ICS 314, we were introduced to a handful of design patterns for the very first time. Seeing patterns and formats through the default meteor template, bowfolios, digits, as well as a handful of patterns used for the WODs. These patterns are incredibly useful going forward because they could be repurposed for a lot of the upcoming experiences. Even being helpful in providing a basis for the final project. Simple aspects like the navbar, sign-in/sign-up, and landing page are useful in almost every application we've made so far and are vital in applications going foward. I can easily see using these designs outside of class for future projects. Within 314 they've been vital to consistent and convienent starting points. It was pretty much encouraged for the latter half of the WODs to have these prepared. It saved potentially hours of setup time which allowed WOD takers to focus primarily on the WODs requirements instead of the initial setup. On top of this, because we were given a plethora of design patterns, we had many options to choose from depending on the requirments of the assingment. Like Island Snow being useful for any following Island Snow WODs and experiences, ie a simple landing page with a background, header, navbar, and footer. In that case there was no need for something like Bowfolios which has a little too much meat on its bones for the earlier applications. Overall this just displays the versatility of the design patterns used in 314, and how the choice of design pattern played a big role in optimizing developer productivity.
