**What are "smart" and "stupid" questions?**
Every developer shares a common need for assisstance at some point in their career path. Java was the first language that I learned and I remember asking lots of questions and using tons of resources to figure out how to do the things I wanted. I'm sure I've asked my fair share of "stupid" and "smart" questions. A main problem that arises with asking "stupid" questions is the perception of the one asking to be lazy and disinterested in the subject. A "stupid" question is typically a question that the asker could solve by themselves with a little more effort. Such as finding a file on a system or a questions regarding something already heavily documented. Other instances can include questions that are too generalized and lack enough specificity to even answer. These kinds of questions come off as incredibly lazy and typically leads to hostile answers or are ignored entirely. On the opposite spectrum are "smart" questions. "Smart" questions demonstrate some form of attempt to solve the issue. Typically these questions are incredibly specific and recieve in-depth answers that not only build respect for those asking the questions but can help others that come across the same issue. As software engineering is a very communitive field, it's important to ask questions that adhere to the principals of a "smart" question.
