### I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has become an incredibly controversial tool in the technological landscape. Difficulties arise in the morality of using such a tool. Where some compare it to any other software assistant others heavily argue against its use. Regardless of stance it's a piece of modern techonology that has increasingly become an integral part of our daily lives. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of modern day products and software, its ethical implications are scrutinized more than ever. Most arugably the fear of AI being used as a replacement to people due to its incredibly cheap costs. It's comprehensive abilities are truly impressive and prove that it has its usefulness.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs - Truthfully I never felt the need to utilize ChatGPT for experience WODs. While I did hurry during the timer, if I ever ran out of time I'd just restart. If I was ever too stuck then I'd refer to the solution video. My preference would be to withness the professor's solution in an attempt to adopt their styles and answers. I felt that it was better to learn their optimal solutions that could be reused for future Experience WODs as opposed to ChatGPTs specific solutions that oftened strayed from the teachings of the class.  

   2. In-class Practice WODs - ChatGPT did aid in practice WODs further down the line. Initially I was entirely against using AI for any assignments. I felt the need to challenge myself in the class. For the Practice WODs earlier in the semester they were simple enough to get by. Towards the latter half I did notice I was using ChatGPT to help primarily for small syntax errors. Like finding missing semicolons or mispelled methods or blocks. In that regard it was incredibly helpful if the IDE was unable to pick it up. Especially in a time sensitive situation like Practice WODs. Outside of small syntax I preferred not to use ChatGPT. Practice WODs felt like a space to comfortably challenge myself without the risk of tanking a grade. I could use the entire allotted time to fully attempt to complete it with my knowledge. 

  3. In-class WODs - In-Class WODs were somewhat of a different story. Similarly to the practice WODs I didn't utilize ChatGPT for the former half of the semester. I was still in the headspace of challenging myself without the aid of AI. Towards the latter half I did start to see the usefulness and the struggles that came from it.
