### I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has become an incredibly controversial tool in the technological landscape. Difficulties arise in the morality of using such a tool. Where some compare it to any other software assistant others heavily argue against its use. Regardless of stance it's a piece of modern techonology that has increasingly become an integral part of our daily lives. As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of modern day products and software, its ethical implications are scrutinized more than ever. Most arugably the fear of AI being used as a replacement to people due to its incredibly cheap costs. It's comprehensive abilities are truly impressive and prove that it has its usefulness.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs - Truthfully I never felt the need to utilize ChatGPT for experience WODs. While I did hurry during the timer, if I ever ran out of time I'd just restart. If I was ever too stuck then I'd refer to the solution video. My preference would be to withness the professor's solution in an attempt to adopt their styles and answers. I felt that it was better to learn their optimal solutions that could be reused for future Experience WODs as opposed to ChatGPTs specific solutions that oftened strayed from the teachings of the class.  

   2. In-class Practice WODs - ChatGPT did aid in practice WODs further down the line. Initially I was entirely against using AI for any assignments. I felt the need to challenge myself in the class. For the Practice WODs earlier in the semester they were simple enough to get by. Towards the latter half I did notice I was using ChatGPT to help primarily for small syntax errors. Like finding missing semicolons or mispelled methods or blocks. In that regard it was incredibly helpful if the IDE was unable to pick it up. Especially in a time sensitive situation like Practice WODs. Outside of small syntax I preferred not to use ChatGPT. Practice WODs felt like a space to comfortably challenge myself without the risk of tanking a grade. I could use the entire allotted time to fully attempt to complete it with my knowledge. 

  3. In-class WODs - In-Class WODs were somewhat of a different story. Similarly to the practice WODs I didn't utilize ChatGPT for the former half of the semester. I was still in the headspace of challenging myself without the aid of AI. Towards the latter half I did start to see the usefulness and the struggles that came from it. For the simpler prompts it did aid in just verifying that the code should work as expected, however given the latter halfs more complex prompts it struggled heavily with producing the desired outcomes and in some cases made the WODs more challenging. Specifically looking at the website design WODs, ChatGPT had no access or understanding of what the visual elements needed to look like. This created a difficult environment to work with and I felt I was better off preparing for the WOD before hand with the practice WODs. 

  4. Essays - Writing essays with the aid of AI has been a thing before ChatGPT. Grammarly is a popular grammar tool that was heavily popularized and aimed towards students to help ensure that their essays were cohesive and well-written. While I didn't personally use grammarly, I used ChatGPT in a very similar manner to review my essay and ensure that the ideas presented made sense. Ever since ChatGPT's popularization, it's been a commonly used tool to just outright write the essays for students. I never used in this way because, 1. Trackers already exist that can predict what percentage of the essay was written using AI, 2. AI cannot replicate one's writing style. Everyone has their own means of writing and if I had ChatGPT simply write mine then it would exactly be my own thoughts behind the words. 

  5. Final project - Honestly I haven't used ChatGPT in the slightest for the final project. I think that any of the issues that have arised within the final project are beyond ChatGPT's abilities. This goes back to it's inabilities to comprehend visual elements which the Final Project for this class mostly consists of. Even for the non-visual elements, if I really needed help I just referred to previous assignments and experiences. For the sake of this project I don't see myself finding any usefulness in ChatGPT. 

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial - 

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
