It would be incredibly easy to say, "I'm going into Softare Engineering because the pay is good". While this is true, there is also a plethora of problems that begin to arise.

### Overview
Computer Science is an incredible field with a wide variety of different branches and jobs. In High School we were told that Computer Science degrees are highly desired in the current job economy. I had other interests at the time like IT and Hardware Engineering but I decided to take my hand at Computer Science. I liked how diverse the field is and all the opportunities that would become available with a degree in the field. That being said, this degree is not for the faint of heart. It has been very challenging so far. It is still a STEM major and thus is academically strenuous. The coding itself is like a whole different language to learn. Problem solving is incredibly vital to completing the projects and assignments. 

### In The Moment
It's hard to rate the difficulty of the major as it progresses over the years. Part of me would like to say that I'm struggling less than I was before, that the basics of programming have been engrained into my brain after nearly two years of experience. To this point I've interacted with 4 different languages, 2 OS's, and many IDEs. No experience is the same, and while blanketed logic can be applied each system and language has its own quirks. I just completed ICS 212 and I'd say it was probably the most intensive Computer Science class I've taken so far. We had to learn C, which compared to Java was ancient. There were none of the quality of life features that I had grown dependent on and it required the programmer to do almost all of the heavy lifting. On top of that, we were forced to use a UNIX system which has no GUI. This was also challenging and really ripped me out of my element. 

### Maybe it's a Pattern?
Besides all of this, it feels like every major difficulty of a class really tries to prep you for real life scenarios. While it's difficult in class, these realistic experiences provide challenges that you can call back on in the future. I've been wanting to start some web based projects and since Javascript is an ideal language for that I'm hoping that ICS 314 will help pave the way for my abilities to sharpen. I've made one Discord bot but it's really dicey and I don't think I fully understand how it works. I'd love to be able to have full control and knowledge behind something that I can create. My friends and I always have tons of ideas that I'd love to make a reality but lack the know-how to do so. This class seems incredibly driving and I'm hoping to be able to build the knowledge of Javascript to start tackling these web applications.
